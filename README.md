Final Project CSC7 Vigenere Cipher
This project was completed by me and Natalia Carbajal completing the task of creating a program for a user to utilize Vigenere Cipher to encrypt and decrypt. The user first is introduced to a menu where he or she may encrypt or decrypt a message using a key. To encrypt the user will enter a message and a key to shift letters of the english alphabet to an encrypted message. Once encrypted our project can be tested by then selecting decrypt, entering the encrypted code and the same key as before.
